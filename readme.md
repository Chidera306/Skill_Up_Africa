## Polymorphism
 A polymorphism is aan object oriented concept that has many forms.
 ### Concise explanation of Polymorphism
Think of a basic pot as a class with a method to cook beans.
#### Using pressure pot and an ordinary pot.
The input parameters(ingredients) for that cooking method are a scoop of pepper, salt, maggi, tomatoes, oil, onions, meat, beans and water. I wait a bit for it to cook and the output(porridge beans) is a fresh porridge beans.
Now. although these two pots have exact same type of ingrtedients and output the way they are cooked is very different . Pressure pot uses pressure to cook the beans and the ordinary pot uses heat to cook the beans.
The porridge beans(Object) received are the same type of object, their attributes may have some different values when it comes to taste and texture.
